<p style="text-align: center;">
After the completion of the First Draft of "The Apparition's Wrath," the book has gone through a multitude of changes. These are excerpts as the story stands now.
</p>

<div class="container">

    <div class="col-sm text-center rounded row-one">

<p><strong>Excerpt of the Book- The Fall of Three: Callidus</strong></p>
<p>“Look to your father, boy. There he is, chained like a raving mut who has bit a child. Like a wild beast who has wandered from his cave.”</p>
<p>The monarch stood, grabbing the hand of the boy to lead him to his father. The click of his boots against the stone floor soon brought him face to face with the mad craftsman. He reached out his hand with a smirk, egging the craftsman to try and thrash out again. The chained man jumped forward, eager to try and bite at the hand that held his fate. However, he wasn’t quick enough as the King pulled his hand back and clicked his tongue, looking down towards the boy once more.
</p>
<p>“Do you know what we do with wild dogs that misbehave, child?”</p>
<p>The king nodded towards the guards, taking a step back towards the throne as the craftsman was forced to his knees. With a solemn look passing over his face, the king pulled the blade of the disgruntled villager from his belt, twisting it in between his fingers to place it into the boy’s hand. </p>
<p>“We put them down.”</p>

    </div>
    <div class="col-sm text-center rounded row-two">
      <p><strong>Excerpt of the Book- The Fall of Three: Ursa </strong></p>
<p>“Callidus will die by our hand. We will destroy The Spire before it is complete, and we will burn his scribes and scrolls, so that no man will write the dreaded name Callidus ever again.”</p>
<p>Nearby men and women nodded in agreement, waving over soldiers and servants alike as Ursa stood to his feet, wiping his mouth before continuing on his tirade.</p>
<p>“We will do all to him as he has done to us! We will cut down his servants and imprison his concubines. We will tear down the shrines of Wola and build up the shrines of Pren! For my god is the goddess of will, and her will is to rule over all who oppose her! So we will cut out his tongue and beg him to sing, we will slice through his legs and beg him to dance, we will bite at his fingers and beg him to fight!”
</p>
<p>A crowd had gathered, striking their shields and shouting in agreement. Ursa jumped to the table, knocking over food and drink alike as he paced like a man possessed. </p>
<p>“Yet this is not enough, for we know that any revolting thing we could think of has already been done by the dastard King Callidus. So study, my friends! Study the blade and the book, so that every time you face a Thesrian soldier, they will be your pupil, and you will teach them that the penance for the sins of their king is death!” </p>
    </div>
      <div class="col-sm text-center rounded row-three">
      <p><strong>Excerpt of the Book- The Fall of Three: Largo</strong></p>
<p>“Father! Father! I will befriend the chickens! Then they will defend you when you’re all old and wrinkly!” </p>
<p>Largo’s mouth dropped open, agape in mock horror as he set Crescend back down. His hands fell to his own chubby face, massaging his cheeks with wide eyes.
</p>
<p>“No! Say it is not so! Have you seen the future, my little seer? Will chickens share the throne with me? Will I truly get old? Will my beautiful face be covered in wrinkles? Please, say it is not so!!”</p>
<p>Crescend merely laughed, placing his blue stained hands against his father's, guiding them around the king’s face.</p>
<p>“Well, father. Only one of things will come to pass. Do you know what it is?” Crescend waited a moment as his father shook his head. Within moments, a wry smile spread across his lips, jumping out of Largo’s arms to run towards the door. He turned back before escaping, leaning against the large wooden frame with a mischievous glint in his eye. “The chickens will rule! After all, you are already old and your face is already wrinkly!” </p>
